#  📚 Todo List

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The objective of this challenge is to create a task list using React and Redux. Users can add tasks, mark them as urgent, complete them, and delete them.

- A task marked as urgent should be created with an "URGENT" badge.
- Urgent tasks should appear first in the list.
- A checked task is considered completed, and its text should be crossed out.
- Clicking on the trash can should delete the task.
- Use Redux with a reducer in charge of the task list (in the file reducers/tasks.js).
- Finally, make sure to keep the existing icons, class names, and IDs. Otherwise, tests will fail, and the challenge won't be validated.
